# Hough Transform - C Implementation on PIC16F18875 Platform

Hough Transform Implementation in C language that provides the Hough Accumulator Matrix as serial output (UART)

### Prerequisites

- XC8 Compiler on MPLAB X IDE

- PIC16F18875

- Curiosity board (Optional)

### Compiling

- Open the MPLAB X IDE

- Include the folder project

- Clean and Build the project

### Executing

- Select in project properties to run as Simulator with UART I/O Output Enabled and run as Debugger mode OR

- Select in project properties to run as Microchip Starter Kit then select Curiosity and program the PIC16F18875. After that run the python script holding the Curiosity reset button and release the button after the script is executed so that the application starts in the PIC and the reading by the serial begins.
